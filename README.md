# Old World Gods

Old world gods is a WIP mod, **Everything said here is planned unless it's stated to be implemented**, 
offering a faction to compete against the empire.

Now, there's a benefit from going against the empire.

## Choose a god

Either side with the empire for tradition empire benefits, or join a god of chaos.

Every god offers random spells, requiring them to be found through sacrifice or experimentation.

Different gods take different tolls on the casters, from your colonists aging to the corruption
of your colonists.

## Strengthen your god

Corrupt settlements to worship your god, fight off the empire, and prepare to unleash chaos across the rim

## Custom quests

Quests now give you a way to strengthen your side, taking out technology caches and powerful warlocks.

## New endings

Full-scale battles once you've become strong enough, ensure the continued existance of your god.

## New interactions

Other chaos gods will vie to spread their influence as well

## New titles (Royalty only)

Royalty has a new ending, after obtaining the next two titles. Requires fighting off the chaos
as well as gaining honor. Fighting chaos also grants honor.
